Build an AlgorithmicOrderScheduler web app with React frontend and AWS CDK backend. It calculates optimal order schedules for manufacturing using different algorithms. 

Create:
- Shared code for data types and algorithms
- CDK backend with API Gateway and Lambda
- React UI with four tabs: Data/Config, Batch, Manual, ManualOutput
- Five ordering algorithms: Flat20, NaiveReplenish, SmartReplenish, AIDesigned, LookAheadLdTm
- Data-dense tables showing order schedules with color-coding for inventory alerts

The app manages ProductionScenarios (manufacturing requirements) and generates OrderSchedules (recommended orders) using selectable algorithms. Users can manually adjust orders and see the impact on inventory. 

Include CloudFront distribution for hosting the React app and ensure all state persists between tab switches.
